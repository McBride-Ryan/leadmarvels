# Lead Marvels

### Description 
Here is a completely revamped version of my landing page. I took the libery of include an additional "About" page. I was able to complete all CSS via class utility. 

### Usage
Laravel/PHP/Node

### Roadmap
I was having some difficulty with the tailwind.config.js. I will add a hover feature over the buttons that allows me to change the color/scale and redirect.
