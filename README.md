# Lead Marvels

### Description 
I scrapped my previous project. I started off by deleting the welcome.blade.php template Laravel provided and started everything from scratch. It took me some time and I hope that is alright. I started to get the hang of it so I added an additional page -- which is more similar to my prior project. I wanted to add some flow to the project. 

### Additions
Additions: I was able to include a sticky nav-bar that is functional. Plus a footer. An animation that guides the user. My css includes Tailwind.  No style tag in the header. I included a background image for the landing page. I was able to get the hover effect to work. I even included some shadows on the cards. 

### Usage
Laravel/PHP/Node

### Roadmap
I was having some difficulty with the tailwind.config.js. I will add a hover feature over the buttons that allows me to change the color/scale and redirect.
